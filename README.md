# Cavy

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/cavy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/cavy) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/pixielabs/cavy.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/pixielabs/cavy)

**Cavy** is a cross-platform, integration test framework for React Native, by
[Pixie Labs](http://pixielabs.io).

Cavy tests allow you to programmatically interact with deeply nested components
within your application. Write your tests in pure JavaScript and run them on
both Android and iOS.

Cavy tests look like this:
```js
export default function(spec) {
  spec.describe('A list of the employees', function() {
    spec.it('can be filtered by search input', async function() {
      await spec.exists('EmployeeList.JimCavy');
      await spec.fillIn('SearchBar.TextInput', 'Amy');
      await spec.press('Button.FilterSubmit');
      await spec.notExists('EmployeeList.JimCavy');
      await spec.exists('EmployeeList.AmyTaylor');
    });
  });
}
```

your functionality is fully tested. Please do this :)

  or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
- Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it
  and/or contributed it.
- Fork the project.
- Start a feature/bugfix branch.
- Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
- Remember to
  [submit a PR to DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/cavy)
